# The Healthcare Data Hub: A Centralized Platform for Informed Decision-Making

This project involves containerizing a Streamlit application using Docker, then deploying it on a Kubernetes cluster using deployment and service configuration files. The Dockerfile ensures that the application runs in a consistent environment, while the Kubernetes configuration files manage the deployment and networking aspects, making the application accessible to users.

### 1. Application (`app.py`)

The `app.py` file contains the Python code for the Streamlit application.

- **Data Fetching**:
    - `fetch_patients()`: Retrieves 50 random patient records from an external API.
    - `fetch_facilities()`: Retrieves healthcare facility data from an external API.
- **Data Generation**:
    - `generate_healthcare_data(num_records)`: Generates random healthcare service data.
    - `generate_medication_data(num_records)`: Generates random medication data.
- **Data Transformation**:
    - `transform_patients(data)`: Transforms raw patient data into a structured format.
    - `assign_services_to_patients(patients, services)`: Assigns healthcare services to patients.
    - `assign_medications_to_patients(patients, medications)`: Assigns medications to patients.
- **Visualizations**:
    - Bar charts for service cost distribution, medication cost distribution, and service count by type.
    - A line chart for medication cost over time.

### 2. Docker Setup (`Dockerfile`)

The `Dockerfile` is used to containerize the Streamlit application. Hereâ€™s what it typically includes:

- **Base Image**: Specifies the base image (usually a Python image) to build upon.
- **Dependency Installation**: Installs the required Python packages.
- **Copy Application Files**: Copies the application files into the Docker image.
- **Port Exposure**: Exposes the necessary port for the Streamlit application.
- **Run Command**: Specifies the command to start the Streamlit app.

### 3. Kubernetes Deployment Configuration (`deployment.yaml`)

The `deployment.yaml` file is used to define the Kubernetes deployment. It includes:

- **Metadata**: Information such as the deployment name.
- **Spec**: Details about the replicas, Docker image to use, and the ports.
- **Containers**: Defines the container specifications, including image and ports.

### 4. Kubernetes Service Configuration (`service.yaml`)

The `service.yaml` file configures how the application is exposed to the network. It includes:

- **Metadata**: Information such as the service name.
- **Spec**: Details about the service type (ClusterIP, NodePort, or LoadBalancer) and the ports.

### Modular Code Overview

The Healthcare Pipeline project is divided into the following modules:

#### 1. App

* **`app.py`**: Contains the code for the Streamlit application.
* **`requirements.txt`**: Contains the dependencies required to run the application.

#### 2. Docker

* **`Dockerfile`**: Contains the instructions to build the Docker image.
* **`docker-compose.yml`**: Contains the configuration to run the application with Docker Compose.

#### 3. Kubernetes

* **`deployment.yaml`**: Defines the Kubernetes deployment specifications.
* **`service.yaml`**: Configures the Kubernetes service for network exposure.

#### 4. Data Generation

* **`data_generation.py`**: Contains the code to generate synthetic data.

#### 5. Data Processing

* **`data_processing.py`**: Contains the code to process data.

#### 6. Monitoring

* **`monitoring.py`**: Contains the code to monitor the application.

### Project Workflow

1. **Building the Docker Image**:
    - Using the Dockerfile, create a Docker image of the Streamlit application.
    - Command: `docker build -t your-docker-image-name .`
2. **Pushing the Docker Image**:
    - Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
    - Command: `docker push your-docker-image-name`
3. **Deploying to Kubernetes**:
    - Apply the Kubernetes deployment and service configurations to deploy the application.
    - Commands:
        - `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`
        - `kubectl apply -f service.yaml`
4. **Accessing the Application**:
    - The Kubernetes service will expose the application, making it accessible via a network endpoint.

### Files Involved

- **`app.py`**: Contains the code for the Streamlit application.
- **`Dockerfile`**: Contains instructions to build the Docker image.
- **`deployment.yaml`**: Defines the Kubernetes deployment specifications.
- **`service.yaml`**: Configures the Kubernetes service for network exposure.
